            The course
          </h2>
          <p>
            Javascript has become one of the most popular languages on the web but it still suffers to date from poor and hasty design decisions made during it’s infancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            CoffeeScript — a fairly new language inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell — compiles into Javascript, aims to highlight Javascript’s good parts while hiding its “dark sides” and to make the whole Javascript experience just that much more enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            This (free) course will teach a basic understanding of the language as well as attempt to clear out some of the misunderstandings that seem to keep people from integrating CoffeeScript into their workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first part, the attendees will learn the fundamental concepts behind CoffeeScript as well as discover some of the existing tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part — an interactive workshop — will show CoffeeScript in action. Attendees are invited to try their newly earned skills on a small application and to hopefully discover the ‘power of CoffeeScript’.

            For those who want to participate in the practical part of the course, a laptop with a working CoffeeScript installation is required. This is most easily accomplished via
            <a href='https://npmjs.org/' title='Visit npmjs.org'>
              npm
            </a>
            by running
            <code>npm install -g coffee-script</code>
            <br>
            For other cases consult the documentation at
            <a href='http://coffeescript.org/#installation' title='Read the docs at coffeescript.org'>

            The Coach
          </h2>
          <p>
            Florian Plank has been working on the web for nearly a decade. With a strong background in visual design, most of his work happens on the client side and so Javascript has been his trusty tool along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having discovered Ruby as his go–to language a few years back, Florian has ever since been even more dissatisfied by the shortcomings of Javascript and didn’t think long when CoffeeScript appeared. He never looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Florian runs a small software shop called
            <a href='http://polarblau.com' title='Visit polarblau.com'>
              Polarblau
            </a>
            in Finland and helps companies big and small alike to design and build better software for an open web.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find Florian online under @polarblau where it counts.
