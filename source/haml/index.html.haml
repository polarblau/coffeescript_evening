              %p
                Javascript has become one of the most popular languages on the
                web but it still suffers to date from poor and hasty design
                decisions made during it’s infancy.
              %p
                CoffeeScript — a fairly new language inspired by Ruby, Python
                and Haskell — compiles into Javascript, aims to highlight
                Javascripts good parts while hiding its “dark sides” and
                to make the whole Javascript experience just that much more enjoyable.

                This (free) course will teach a basic understanding of the
                language as well as attempt to clear out some of the misunderstandings
                that seem to keep people from integrating CoffeeScript into their workflow.
              %p
                In the first part, the attendees will learn the fundamental concepts
                behind CoffeeScript as well as discover some of the existing tools.
              %p
                The second part — an interactive workshop — will show CoffeeScript
                in action. Attendees are invited to try their newly earned skills on
                a small application and to hopefully discover the ‘power of CoffeeScript’.

              For those who want to participate in the practical part of the
              course, a laptop with a working CoffeeScript
              installation is required. This is most easily accomplished
              via
              %a(href="https://npmjs.org/" title="Visit npmjs.org")
                npm
              by running
              %code
                npm install -g coffee-script
              %br
              For other cases consult the documentation at
              %a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#installation" title="Read the docs at coffeescript.org")
                coffeescript.org
              or
              %a(href="mailto:florian@polarblau.com" title="Send Florian an email")
                get in touch with Florian
              (lecturer).

            The Lecturer
          %img(src="/images/florian.png" alt="Florian Plank")
          %p
            Florian Plank has been working on the web for nearly a decade.
            With a strong background in visual design, most of his work
            happens on the client side and so Javascript has been his
            trusty tool along the way.
          %p
            Having discovered Ruby as his go–to language a few years back,
            Florian has ever since been even more
            dissatisfied by the shortcomings of Javascript and didn’t think
            long when CoffeeScript appeared. He never looked back.
          %p
            Florian runs a small software shop called
            %a(href="http://polarblau.com" title="Visit polarblau.com")
              Polarblau
            in Finland and helps companies big and small alike to
            design and build better software for an open web.
          %p
            You can find Florian online under @polarblau where it counts.
