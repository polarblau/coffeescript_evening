            The course
          %p
            Javascript has become one of the most popular languages on the web but it still suffers to date from poor and hasty design decisions made during it’s infancy.
          %p
            CoffeeScript — a fairly new language inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell — compiles into Javascript, aims to highlight Javascript’s good parts while hiding its “dark sides” and to make the whole Javascript experience just that much more enjoyable.
          %p
            This (free) course will teach a basic understanding of the language as well as attempt to clear out some of the misunderstandings that seem to keep people from integrating CoffeeScript into their workflow.
          %p
            In the first part, the attendees will learn the fundamental concepts behind CoffeeScript as well as discover some of the existing tools.
          %p
            The second part — an interactive workshop — will show CoffeeScript in action. Attendees are invited to try their newly earned skills on a small application and to hopefully discover the ‘power of CoffeeScript’.

            For those who want to participate in the practical part of the course, a laptop with a working CoffeeScript installation is required. This is most easily accomplished via
            %a(href="https://npmjs.org/" title="Visit npmjs.org")
              npm
            by running
            %code
              npm install -g coffee-script
            %br
            For other cases consult the documentation at
            %a(href="http://coffeescript.org/#installation" title="Read the docs at coffeescript.org")
              coffeescript.org
            or
            %a(href="mailto:florian@polarblau.com" title="Send Florian an email")
              get in touch with Florian (coach).

            The Coach
          -#%img(src="/images/florian.png" alt="Florian Plank")
          %p
            Florian Plank has been working on the web for nearly a decade. With a strong background in visual design, most of his work happens on the client side and so Javascript has been his trusty tool along the way.
          %p
            Having discovered Ruby as his go–to language a few years back, Florian has ever since been even more dissatisfied by the shortcomings of Javascript and didn’t think long when CoffeeScript appeared. He never looked back.
          %p
            Florian runs a small software shop called
            %a(href="http://polarblau.com" title="Visit polarblau.com")
              Polarblau
            in Finland and helps companies big and small alike to design and build better software for an open web.
          %p
            You can find Florian online under @polarblau where it counts.
